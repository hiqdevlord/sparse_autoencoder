Introduction
------------------------
  This is a Multi-processing version of Stacked Sparse Autoencoder. I applied the API provided by Dpark, which is a Map-Reduce alike computing framework at Douban Inc.. Note that Dpark is the python version cloned from Spark, it can support iterative computation and thus accelerate the training process of Stacked AE.
